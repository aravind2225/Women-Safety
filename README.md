# 👩‍🦰 Women Safety Analysis & Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting factors related to **women’s safety** using data-driven approaches.  
The goal is to identify unsafe zones, patterns of incidents, and build a system that can assist in creating awareness and preventive measures for women’s safety.  

The project is implemented in **Python (Google Colab)** with exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
Women’s safety is a major concern in modern societies. By leveraging **data analysis and machine learning**, we can:  
- Detect **crime hotspots**.  
- Analyze **time and location patterns** of incidents.  
- Build a model to predict potential unsafe conditions.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis** on women safety datasets.  
- Visualize unsafe areas and highlight **high-risk time zones**.  
- Apply machine learning models to predict the likelihood of unsafe conditions.  
- Provide actionable insights for improving safety.  

---

## 🔎 Dataset  
The dataset used contains information about **crime records / safety incidents** with attributes such as:  
- **Location** (latitude, longitude, or district/city name)   
- **Type of crime / incident**  
- **Age of Victim**

> *(The dataset may vary depending on availability, but the focus is on safety-related incidents.)*

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning missing values  
   - Formatting dates & locations  
   - Encoding categorical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Crime frequency by **day, month, and hour**  
   - Heatmaps of crime-prone locations  

3. **Modeling & Prediction**  
   - As this is an Unsupervised problem,Used Clustering Model(K-Means) to Get my work done.  
   - Evaluation using metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**.

## 💻 Tech Stack  
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn,  
- **Notebook**: Google Colab  

---

## 📊 Insights & Impact  
- Identified **high-risk locations and timings** for women.  
- Predicted safety conditions using ML models.  
- Insights can be used by **law enforcement, NGOs, and communities** to improve safety measures.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how **data analytics and machine learning** can be applied to enhance **women’s safety awareness**.  
By predicting and analyzing unsafe conditions, we can move towards **building safer environments** for women.
